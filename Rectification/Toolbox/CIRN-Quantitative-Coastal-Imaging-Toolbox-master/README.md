# CIRN-Quantitative-Coastal-Imaging-Toolbox
The CIRN Introduction to Quantitative Coastal Imaging Toolbox is a collection of MATLAB scripts to produce geo-rectified images specifically tailored for quantitative analysis of coastal environments. The repository performs end-to-end georectification of oblique imagery from land-based multi/single-camera stations or stationary Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition to rectified frames, the toolbox produces ensemble products such as statistical or subsampled pixel collections for optical wave, current and bathymetric inversion analyses. While experts have employed similar scripts operationally for years, this toolbox is for photogrammetry novices. Demos teach fundamentals but also can be easily transitioned to turn-key applications for operational data processing. Please see user_manual.pdf for guidance.
